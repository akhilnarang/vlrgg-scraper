# VLR.gg scraper

This is an unofficial scraper for vlr.gg in order to provide the data in a machine readable format.

## Usage

### Install [uv](https://astral.sh/uv)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Run the development server
```bash
uv run fastapi dev
```

You can then access swagger at http://localhost:8000/docs

There's some more stuff, but most won't need it.
